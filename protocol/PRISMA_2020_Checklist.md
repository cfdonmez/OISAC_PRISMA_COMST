| | 13e | Describe any methods used to explore possible causes of heterogeneity among study results (e.g. subgroup analysis, meta-regression). | **11.3 Gap Analysis** | ✅ Compliant |
| | 13f | Describe any sensitivity analyses conducted to assess robustness of the synthesized results. | **10.6 Quality Rating** | ✅ Compliant |
| Reporting bias assessment | 14 | Describe any methods used to assess risk of bias due to missing results in a synthesis (arising from reporting biases). | **10.4 Metric Completeness** | ✅ Compliant |
