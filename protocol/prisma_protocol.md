# Optical ISAC Systematic Review Protocol

## 1. Title
Optical Integrated Sensing and Communication (O-ISAC) over Fibre and Wireless Optical Channels: A Systematic Review

## 2. Background and Rationale
<!-- Buraya RF ISAC literatürü, optik ISAC boşluğu ve 6G bağlamı gelecek. -->

## 3. Objectives
- To systematically identify and classify optical systems (fibre, FSO, VLC, LiDAR-like) that implement integrated sensing and communication at the physical layer.
- To compare their signal models, channel models, hardware constraints, and joint sensing–communication performance trade-offs.

## 4. Eligibility Criteria
### 4.1 Inclusion Criteria
- Uses optical carriers (fibre, FSO, VLC, LiDAR-like) as the main medium.
- Implements both sensing and communication functions using shared or tightly coupled optical hardware/signal resources.
- Peer-reviewed journal or conference articles.
- Published in English.

### 4.2 Exclusion Criteria
- Pure RF ISAC systems with no optical component.
- Pure LiDAR or pure FSO/VLC communication without any sensing or without any communication.
- Theses, books, patents (optional: specify).

## 5. Information Sources
- IEEE Xplore
- Scopus
- Web of Science
- arXiv (for preprints, if considered)

## 6. Search Strategy
<!-- Buraya PRISMA-S ile uyumlu tam arama stringleri ve filtre mantığı gelecek. -->

## 7. Selection Process
- Stage 1: Title/abstract screening by predefined eligibility criteria.
- Stage 2: Full-text screening for potentially relevant records.
- Decisions recorded in `screening/screening_log.csv`.

## 8. Data Collection Process
- Data extraction performed according to `extraction/schema/oisac_extraction_schema.yaml`.
- Separate CSV files for fibre-based and wireless-based O-ISAC studies.

## 9. Risk of Bias / Methodological Quality Assessment
<!-- Buraya "sinyal modeli açıklığı, kanal modelinin varlığı, metriklerin netliği" gibi teknik kalite kriterleri gelecek. -->

## 10. Data Synthesis
- Qualitative synthesis with taxonomy tables and comparison figures.
- No meta-analysis is planned (continuous and heterogeneous metrics).
