(a) **BER vs Center Frequency (GHz):** This chart shows the Bit Error Rate (BER) as a function of the center frequency. The BER decreases from approximately 1.8E-2 at 118 GHz to a minimum of 1.0E-3 at 132 GHz, then increases back to approximately 1.8E-2 at 142 GHz. The insets display electrical spectra at 118 GHz and 142 GHz, illustrating the modulated signal.
(b) **BER vs Vpp (mV):** This chart plots BER against the peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp). The BER starts at approximately 2.0E-2 at 400 mV, reaches a minimum of 1.0E-3 at 600 mV, and then rises to approximately 6.0E-3 at 900 mV. Insets show 16QAM constellation diagrams at 400 mV and 600 mV.
(c) **BER vs Baudrate (GHz):** This chart illustrates the BER performance as the baudrate increases. The BER rises from approximately 1.5E-4 at 15 GHz to about 4.5E-3 at 30 GHz. Insets show a 16QAM constellation diagram at 15 GHz and an electrical spectrum at 30 GHz.
(d) **BER vs Fiberlength (km):** This bar chart shows the BER for different fiber lengths. The BER increases with fiber length: approximately 5.0E-4 for 0 km, 1.5E-3 for 10 km, and 2.5E-3 for 20 km.
(e) **BER vs Optical Power (dBm):** This chart presents BER against optical power for different fiber lengths: "wo fiber" (without fiber), "10-km fiber", and "20-km fiber". For all cases, BER decreases with increasing optical power. To achieve a BER of 1E-3, approximately -14.5 dBm is required without fiber, -13.5 dBm for 10-km fiber, and -12.5 dBm for 20-km fiber, indicating a power penalty with increased fiber length.

Image [_page_2_Figure_2.jpeg]: Diagram.
(a) This diagram illustrates a fiber-wireless integrated system architecture for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). A Central Unit/Distributed Unit (CU/DU) sends an "ISAC signal" via fiber to an Active Antenna Unit (AAU). The AAU converts this to a "THz Beam" for communication with and sensing of remote targets like a drone and a car outdoors, or people indoors. Reflected THz signals ("THz echo") are received by the AAU, processed into a "De-chirped Sensing Signal", and sent back to the CU/DU via the same fiber.
(b) This detailed diagram shows the signal processing flow at the AAU. The top branch depicts the communication path where the optical "ISAC signal" from the fiber is converted to electrical (O/E) and then transmitted as a "THz signal." The bottom branch illustrates the sensing path: a "THz echo" from a target and a "Ref. signal" are both fed into a "Full-Photonic De-chirping" module. The output, a "Sensing signal," is then transmitted back through the fiber to the CU/DU for further analysis.

Image [_page_3_Figure_2.jpeg]: Setup.
This image displays a comprehensive experimental setup for an ISAC system, divided into three main functional blocks: CU/DU (Central Unit/Distributed Unit), AAU (Active Antenna Unit), and UE (User Equipment)/Targets.
The **CU/DU** section includes:
*   A transmitter path with ECL-1 and ECL-2 (External Cavity Lasers), an AWG (Arbitrary Waveform Generator), an IQM (In-phase/Quadrature Modulator) containing MZM-Q and MZM-I (Mach-Zehnder Modulators), and EDFA-1 (Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier 1) for optical signal generation and modulation.
*   A receiver path with a BPD (Balanced Photodetector), EA (Electrical Amplifier), and OSC (Oscilloscope) for sensing signal analysis. A tap at point C provides a reference signal for de-chirping.
The CU/DU connects to the **AAU** via a Single Mode Fiber (SMF).
The **AAU** section includes:
*   A transmit path with a VOA (Variable Optical Attenuator), EDFA-2, PD (Photodetector) for optical-to-electrical conversion, PA (Power Amplifier), and HA (Horn Antenna) for transmitting THz signals. Point D indicates the electrical signal for THz transmission.
*   A receive path with a HA, LNA (Low Noise Amplifier), PA, and a TFLN-MZM (Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Mach-Zehnder Modulator) acting as a photonic mixer for de-chirping the received THz echo signal using a portion of the transmitted optical signal (tapped at Point A) as a local oscillator. The de-chirped signal is sent back to the CU/DU via the fiber (tapped at Point B).
The **UE/Targets** section represents the wireless environment with horn antennas, amplifiers (LNA, EA), a frequency multiplier (x12), and an oscilloscope, along with multiple "Targets" (triangles) that generate reflections for sensing.

(a) **TFTPR (dB) vs DC bias (V):** This chart shows the Two-Tone Flatness Power Ratio (TFTPR) as a function of DC bias voltage. It exhibits a "W" shape, with minimum TFTPR (indicating better performance) of approximately -40 dB occurring at the MITP (Minimum TFTPR) at 2.0 V, and at the MATP (Maximum Amplitude Transmission Point) at 0.0 V and 4.0 V. Maximum TFTPR (approximately 40 dB) occurs at the QBP (Quiescent Bias Point) at 1.0 V and 3.0 V.
(b) **Amplitude (dB) vs Frequency (GHz) (Red Line):** This spectral plot shows peaks corresponding to targets. It identifies a "False Target" at 152.59 MHz (amplitude approx. 20 dB), a "True Target" at 305.17 MHz (amplitude approx. 35 dB), and another "True Target" at 457.76 MHz (amplitude approx. 38 dB).
(c) **Amplitude (dB) vs Frequency (GHz) (Blue Line):** This spectral plot, likely corresponding to an optimized DC bias, shows "True Targets" at 305.17 MHz (amplitude approx. 38 dB) and 457.76 MHz (amplitude approx. 35 dB). The false target observed in (b) is significantly suppressed or absent.
(d) **Amplitude (dB) vs Frequency (GHz) (Orange Line):** This spectral plot shows a dominant "False Target" at 152.59 MHz (amplitude approx. 38 dB), with no clear indication of the true targets at 305.17 MHz or 457.76 MHz. This suggests a scenario where only the false target is prominently detected, possibly due to a specific operating condition or bias point.

**Amplitude (dB) vs Frequency (GHz):** This chart displays a frequency spectrum. It identifies three distinct peaks: a "False Target" at 152.59 MHz with an amplitude of approximately 22 dB, a "True Target" at 305.17 MHz with an amplitude of approximately 38 dB, and another "True Target" at 457.76 MHz with an amplitude of approximately 35 dB. The true targets have significantly higher amplitudes than the false target in this representation.

    *   SNR generally decreases with increasing fiber length, with the performance difference becoming more pronounced at lower optical powers.
