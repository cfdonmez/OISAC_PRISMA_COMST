The system consists of two setups: an optical fiber sensing system and an optical telecommunication system. The sensing system uses a supercontinuum laser light source, a multiplexer, and a demultiplexer, while the telecommunication system uses a continuum wave laser source, a dual-polarization IQ modulator, and an arbitrary waveform generator. The adiabatic-tapered FMF2 is designed to enhance the sensitivity of the sensing head and minimize the radiation loss of the LP11 mode."
