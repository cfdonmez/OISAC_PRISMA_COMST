Abstract-In this paper, we investigate the visible light-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) channel characteristics in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenario, focusing on monostatic sensing and bi-static sensing modes. The ISAC channel is divided into a target channel and a background channel. The channel impulse response (CIR) at different distances, as well as the fading characteristics, multipath correlation, and delay spread of the channel within the effective sensing distance in the two sensing modes are investigated by ray tracing simulation. The results show that with the increase of distance, the target channel received power ratio of mono-static sensing decreases by 30%, while the received power ratio of bi-static sensing is stable at about 1.06%, the target channel fading of monostatic sensing is faster than that of bi-static sensing. In addition, the linear fi
