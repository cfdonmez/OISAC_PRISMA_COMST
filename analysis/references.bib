  abstract={We experimentally demonstrate the cotransmission of 50 and 60 GBaud 64-level quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) high-speed optical discrete multi-tone (DMT) signal corresponding to the data rate of 117 Gbit/s and 140 Gbit/s, and 60-W power over fiber (PoF) over 1-km 7-core single-mode weakly coupled multi-core fiber (WC-MCF) for the first time. In this demonstration, the optical power transmission efficiency (OPTE) of energy light is up to 53.9%, and the collected optical power at the remote unit (RU) can be up tp 32.4 W. Meanwhile, the bit error rates (BERs) of 50 GBaud and 60 GBaud 64-QAM DMT signal in the intensity modulation direct detection (IM-DD) system at RU are all lower than the soft decision forward error correction (SD-FEC) threshold of 2E-2. In addition, the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) of 50 GBaud is more than 22 dB within the limit established in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defined requirement.},

  abstract={Visible Light Positioning and Communication (VLPC) is a promising candidate for implementing Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) in the unlicensed 400 THz to 800 THz band. The current Visible Light Positioning (VLP) systems mainly operate based on the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of the Line-of-Sight (LoS) path. However, its accuracy is degraded by interferences from Non-LoS (NLoS) paths. Furthermore, in Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems, the estimation of Channel State Information (CSI) also becomes challenging, when the optical channel becomes dispersive. Against this background, we propose a new VLPC scheme using Direct Current (DC) biased Optical Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (VLPC-DCO-OFDM), where OFDM-based sensing is applied for the sake of improving the resolution of the estimated Channel Impulse Response (CIRs) exploited for positioning functionality. The CIRs estimated by sensing are further exploited to provide enhanced CSI for communication data detection. Moreover, we propose a hybrid Radar-RSS based solution, where the conventional RSS-aided VLP method is invoked for the sake of refining OFDM radar. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed VLPC-DCO-OFDM scheme � which simultaneously supports the triple functionalities of illumination, bi-static sensing and communication � is capable of achieving centimeter-level positioning accuracy and Giga-bits-per-second data rate.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a fiber optic displacement sensing probe based on a common optical path with a Michelson interferometer structure. The sensing model is established by integrating tilted Gaussian optical field diffraction with an optical transmission matrix, establishing a mapping relationship between the internal component parameters of the probe and the coupling efficiency as well as fringe contrast—thereby providing a theoretical basis for probe design. The proposed method enables high precision measurement of R angles and small rough spots in narrow spaces. Simulation results show that the sensing probe has a dynamic working range of 5.42–5.60 mm and an angular tolerance of ±3.84°.},

  title={Integrated Sensing and Communication for UAV Trajectory Optimization in Mixed FSO-RF Networks in Dynamic Weather Conditions}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to transform data transmission and real-time sensing, enhancing sixth-generation (6G) networks. Free-space optical (FSO) communication is a key 6G backhaul solution, complementing radio frequency (RF) technologies like millimeter wave (mmWave) for improved network reliability. However, adverse weather can significantly reduce FSO link reliability due to atmospheric attenuation. Such adverse weather conditions also increase the level of back-scattered light, potentially enabling the real-time sensing of the atmospheric channel gain at the transmitter side. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel optical ISAC (O-ISAC) framework, where the back-scattered light from the FSO communication signal is used as the sensing feedback signal. This O-ISAC framework is analyzed considering a single-cell network aided by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to support edge users. The UAV is connected to the gateway via a FSO backhaul link while estimating the FSO channel gain based on the back-scattered light and dynamically optimizing its trajectory. The aim of this adaptive O-ISAC system is to maximize the end-to-end network throughput of the edge users while considering FSO backhaul capacity and the UAV's directional antenna beamwidth and bandwidth allocation. Numerical results demonstrate that UAV can effectively optimize its trajectory by adjusting the antenna beamwidth and downlink bandwidth allocation at different weather conditions. The proposed framework is tested using hourly visibility data from Edinburgh, demonstrating that optical channel sensing is crucial for the system's overall performance.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In this paper, we investigate the visible light-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) channel characteristics in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenario, focusing on monostatic sensing and bi-static sensing modes. The ISAC channel is divided into a target channel and a background channel. The channel impulse response (CIR) at different distances, as well as the fading characteristics, multipath correlation, and delay spread of the channel within the effective sensing distance in the two sensing modes are investigated by ray tracing simulation. The results show that with the increase of distance, the target channel received power ratio of mono-static sensing decreases by 30%, while the received power ratio of bi-static sensing is stable at about 1.06%, the target channel fading of mono-static sensing is faster than that of bi-static sensing. In addition, the linear fit coefficient of the root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS) values for mono-static sensing is positive with a mean value of 2.95 which is greater than the mean value of 0.32 for the RMS DS values for bi-static sensing, while the linear fit coefficient of the RMS DS values for bi-static sensing is negative. Overall, the bi-static sensing system outperforms at longer distances, has a more stable target signal received power ratio, better handling target signals and background noise, reducing signal RMS DS, and improving transmission quality and anti-interference capabilities, indicating the advantages of bi-static sensing in V2V scenarios using visible light-based ISAC.},
