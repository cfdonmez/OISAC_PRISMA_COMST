## 3. Critical Gaps
-   **Velocity Resolution**: NR.
-   **Maximum Sensing Range**: While unambiguous detection range (10.24m) is mentioned, the practical *detection range* (dictated by SNR, target RCS, etc.) is not explicitly reported beyond the 1m wireless link used in experiments.
-   **Full System Noise Figure/Sensitivity**: Detailed noise figures for the entire sensing chain (beyond just LNA gain and signal power at LNA input) are NR, which limits a full power budget analysis.
-   **Latency**: NR.
