# 🕵️‍♂️ Gemini Deep Research Agent Module

This module isolates the "Agentic Research" phase of the O-ISAC survey pipeline.
Unlike the main extraction pipeline (which extracts data from known PDFs), this agent is designed for **Research & Triage**.

## Structure
- `config/`: System prompts defining the "Systematic Reviewer" persona.
- `output/`: Raw reports and "Evidence Packages" generated by the agent.
- `benchmarks/`: Comparison logs (Human vs Agent) for calibration.

## Workflows
1. **Calibration (Phase 0)**: Run agent on a text inputs of a known paper (`O_ISAC_029`) -> Compare output with Ground Truth.
2. **Search Strategy (Phase 1)**: Agent proposes query terms.
3. **Screening Support (Phase 2)**: Agent triages search results.

## Model
Uses `gemini-2.5-flash` or `gemini-1.5-pro` (via Google GenAI SDK).
