# Phase 1 Screening Report: Title & Abstract

## 1. Overview

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Records Screened** | **510** | 100% |
| **Included** | **158** | **31.0%** |
| Excluded | 352 | 69.0% |

## 2. Included Studies by Media (O-ISAC Domain)

This breakdown reflects the categorization of the **158** included studies.

| Domain (Category) | Count | Percentage of Included |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wireless O-ISAC** | **105** | **66.5%** |
| **Cabled (Fiber) O-ISAC** | **53** | **33.5%** |

## 3. Exclusion Analysis

A total of **352** studies were excluded. The primary reasons are listed below:

| Exclusion Reason | Count | Percentage of Excluded |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| No optical carrier detected | 222 | 63.1% |
| Lacks clear sensation/comms keywords | 34 | 9.7% |
| No optical carrier detected; Likely RF/THz only | 29 | 8.2% |
| Pure communication | 28 | 8.0% |
| Pure sensing | 24 | 6.8% |
| Review/Survey article | 15 | 4.3% |

> **Note:** The dominant exclusion reason ("No optical carrier detected") confirms the initial hypothesis that the broad search query retrieved a significant number of RF/THz ISAC papers unrelated to optical systems.

## 4. Recommendations for Phase 2

1.  **Full-Text Retrieval**: Proceed to retrieve PDFs for the **158** included records.
2.  **Priority**: Focus first on the 105 Wireless O-ISAC papers as they constitute the majority.
3.  **Refinement**: The "Review/Survey article" category (15 papers) should be double-checked during full-text review to identify potential "snowballing" sources (checking their references), even if they are excluded from the primary synthesis.
