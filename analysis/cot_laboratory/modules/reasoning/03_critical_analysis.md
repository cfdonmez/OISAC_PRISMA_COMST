Finally, synthesize this work into the broader **Survey Narrative**.
Instead of just critiquing, identify the **Strategic Implication**.

**Think through the following:**
1.  **The "Solved" vs. "Unsolved":**
    *   What problem did this paper definitively put to rest?
    *   What problem remains? (The "Open Challenge"). *This will feed our "Future Directions" section.*

2.  **Implementation Reality:**
    *   Beyond the lab, what prevents this from being deployed in 6G tomorrow? (Cost? Power? Integration complexity?)

3.  **Reproducibility & Impact:**
    *   Does it offer an open dataset or code? (This marks it as a "community enabler").

*Goal: Extract the points that we will cite in the "Open Challenges" and "Lessons Learned" section of the manuscript.*
