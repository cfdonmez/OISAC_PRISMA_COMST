Now that you have identified the "Enabling Strategy", you must evaluate the **Results** with scientific skepticism.
Your goal is to validate the coherence between the *Proposed Method* and the *Reported Outcomes*, looking for ANY physical or logical inconsistency.

**Think through the following dimensions (use these as open guides, not limits):**

1.  **The Price of Integration (Trade-offs):**
    *   Integration usually comes with a cost. Does the paper admit what was lost? (e.g., Complexity, Speed, Coverage, Power).
    *   If they claim "Simultaneous Sensing & Comm", do the metrics show degradation in either channel compared to a single-function baseline?

2.  **Physical Consistency (Reality Check):**
    *   Do the reported metrics physically align with the hardware/method described?
    *   *Sanity Test:* Look for contradictions. Are the claimed resolution vs. bandwidth, or rate vs. SNR relationships theoretically possible given the technology used? (e.g., Is the claimed resolution physically supportable by the signal bandwidth provided?)
    *   *Flag Suspicion:* If a result seems "Too Good to be True" given the constraints, note it as a potential inconsistency.

3.  **Metric Standardization:**
    *   Convert all disparate units into our project's standard baseline for fair comparison.

*Goal: Ensure the numbers we put in the survey are not just 'transcribed' but 'verified' for internal consistency.*
