Before detailed extraction, you must verify the core premise and identify the specific **Enabling Strategy**.
Do not limit yourself to standard multiplexing techniques; look for any form of resource sharing.

**Think through the following:**
1.  **Dual-Functionality Verification:**
    *   Does the system purpose-fully perform *both* Sensing and Communication?
    *   Confirm it is not just "interference managment" but actual "joint operation".

2.  **The "Coupling Strategy" (The 'Integrated' in O-ISAC):**
    *   *Where* does the integration happen? Analyze all dimensions:
        *   **Signal Level:** Shared Waveform (Joint/Dual-function), Superimposed, or Orthogonal Codes (CDM), etc?
        *   **Resource Level:** Time (TDM), Frequency (FDM), Wavelength (WDM), or Polarization,or something else?
        *   **Spatial Level:** Different cores (SDM), modes (MDM), or beam patterns?
        *   **Hardware Level:** Separate signals sharing common optics/amplifiers (Shared Aperture), or something else?
        *   **Receiver Level:** Independent transmission but Joint Signal Processing at the receiver, or something else?
    *   *Constraint:* Describe exactly what is shared and what is separate.

3.  **The "Technological Enabler":**
    *   What specific innovation permits this coupling? (e.g., A specific photonic integrated circuit, a novel digital signal processing block, a reconfigurable surface, or anything?).

*Goal: Precisely classify the integration architecture without bias toward a specific method.*
