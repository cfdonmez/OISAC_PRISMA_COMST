The system employs a thin-film lithium niobate Mach-Zehnder modulator (TFLN-MZM) for direct reception and de-chirping of the THz LFM echo signal. The TFLN-MZM operates at the minimum transmission point (MITP) to avoid false targets. The system also uses a balanced photodetector (BPD) for coherent homodyne detection of the de-chirped signal."
