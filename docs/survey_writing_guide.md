# O-ISAC Survey Writing Guide (IEEE COMST & PRISMA 2020)

**Target Journal:** IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials (Impact Factor: ~35)
**Standard:** PRISMA 2020 Statement
**Purpose:** This guide serves as a bridge between the `prisma_protocol.md` and the final manuscript, ensuring every section meets both the rigorous reporting standards of PRISMA and the tutorial-style depth required by COMST.

---

## 1. Introduction (PRISMA Item 3 & 4)

**Goal:** Establish the "Why" and "What".
**COMST Requirement:** Must justify why a *new* survey is needed (Gap Analysis of existing surveys).

*   **Rationale (Item 3):**
    *   Start with the broad context: 6G, ISAC, and the "Optical Spectrum" opportunity.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Table comparing *existing surveys* vs. *this survey*. Highlight that previous works focus only on RF, only on Fiber, or only on VLC. This is the first "Unified Physical Layer" review.
*   **Objectives (Item 4):**
    *   Explicitly state the Research Questions (RQ1-RQ3 form Protocol).
    *   Outline the structure of the paper (using the Sunburst Taxonomy concept).

## 2. Fundamentals / Tutorial (IEEE COMST Requirement)

**Goal:** Teach the reader. PRISMA doesn't require this, but COMST *demands* it.
**Note:** This corresponds to the `background` knowledge implicit in our extraction schema but explicit in the paper.

*   **O-ISAC Channel Models:**
    *   One subsection on Fiber Channel (Attenuation, Dispersion, Nonlinearity).
    *   One subsection on FSO/VLC Channel (Path loss, Turbulence, Ambient Light).
*   **Key Hardware Components:**
    *   Brief tutorial on Modulators (MZM vs TFLN), Detectors (PD vs SPAD), and Beam Steering (RIS vs OPA).

## 3. Methodology (PRISMA Items 5-15)

**Goal:** Transparency and Reproducibility. This section is often weaker in engineering surveys; making it strong is a key differentiator.

*   **Search Strategy (Item 7):**
    *   Reference the appendix for full search strings.
    *   Summarize databases (IEEE, Scopus, etc.) and date ranges.
*   **Eligibility Criteria (Item 5):**
    *   Why "Physical Layer" only? Why exclude "Pure Sensing"?
*   **Selection Process (Item 8) & Flow Diagram (Item 16):**
    *   Insert the **PRISMA Flow Diagram** here (generated by `analysis/notebooks/PRISMA_Flowchart_Generator.ipynb`).
    *   Narrate the numbers: "We identified 1200 records, screened 800, and included 158."
*   **Risk of Bias (Item 11):**
    *   Explain the "Technical Quality Appraisal Framework (TQAF)" used (Internal validity, Simulation vs Experiment).

## 4. Main Synthesis: Cabled O-ISAC (Fiber)

*   **Structure:** Follow the Taxonomy.
    *   Integration Strategies (TDM vs FDM vs Joint Waveform).
    *   Sensing Tasks (Vibration, Temperature, Intrusion).
*   **Synthesis Style:**
    *   Do NOT just list papers ("Paper A did this, Paper B did that").
    *   Group by **Solution**: "Approaches to mitigate nonlinearity include [Ref 1, 2, 3]..."

## 5. Main Synthesis: Wireless O-ISAC (FSO/VLC)

*   **Structure:**
    *   FSO-ISAC (Long range, LFM/Chirp based).
    *   VLC-ISAC (Indoor, LED-based, Positioning focus).
    *   LiDAR/Radar-like (Automotive focus).
*   **Synthesis Style:**
    *   Compare performance: "While FSO achieves km-range sensing, VLC is limited to room-scale but offers ubiquitous coverage."

## 6. Performance Trade-offs (PRISMA Item 20 -- Quantitative Description)

**Goal:** The "Engineer's Discussion". Use the data extracted in `tradeoff` fields.

*   **Metrics:** Data Rate (Gbps) vs Sensing Accuracy (RMSE).
*   **Visuals:**
    *   **Bubble Chart:** X-axis = Range, Y-axis = Data Rate, Bubble Size = Resolution.
    *   **Pareto Frontiers:** Discuss studies that explicitly show the trade-off curve (like `O_ISAC_029`).
*   **Discussion:**
    *   "Resource Division (TDM) creates a hard trade-off (linear loss)."
    *   "Joint Waveforms offer better spectral efficiency but higher complexity."

## 7. Open Challenges & Future Directions (PRISMA Item 23)

**Goal:** Guide future research.

*   **Emerging Hardware:** Optical RIS, OPA, Photonic Integrated Circuits.
*   **Methodological Gaps:** Lack of standardized datasets, inconsistency in channel modeling assumptions (identified via TQAF).
*   **6G Integration:** How O-ISAC fits into the larger 6G ecosystem.

*   **Excluded Studies List (Item 16b):** Good practice for full transparency.
