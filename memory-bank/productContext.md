# Product Context

## The Problem
The literature on Optical Integrated Sensing and Communication (O-ISAC) is **fragmented**.
*   **Fiber Sensing** communities (e.g., DAS, φ-OTDR) rarely cross-pollinate with **FSO/VLC** (Wireless) communities.
*   Terminology is inconsistent (e.g., "fiber sensing with comms" vs "ISAC").
*   No unified physical-layer taxonomy exists to describe the "trade-offs" between sensing and communication across these different media.

## The Goal
To create a **Unified Physical-Layer Framework** that:
1.  Classifies O-ISAC systems by **Medium** (Fiber vs Wireless).
2.  Identifies common **Waveform families** (e.g., OFDM, Chirp) used in both domains.
3.  Quantifies the **Sensing-Communication Trade-off** (e.g., Rate vs Resolution).

## Success Criteria
*   Selection of high-quality, peer-reviewed studies (Journal/Conference).
*   Rigorous exclusion of non-optical (RF-only) or pure-sensing/pure-comms papers.
*   A data extraction dataset (CSV/JSON) that allows for quantitative descriptive analysis.
